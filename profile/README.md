### 📺 What is Scuffle?

Scuffle is a live streaming platform that is built from the ground up. We are building a platform that is open-source, and that is built with the community in mind.

We held a [conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvQpMRkzoVM&t=598s) in 2022 going over some of the features that we are aiming to build out this year.

### 👀 Project status

We are currently in the process of building the platform! We are looking for contributors to help us and are always open to new ideas.

We have a public [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/ScuffleTV/projects/1/views/6) and [kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/ScuffleTV/projects/1/views/1) where we update the statuses of the projects and tickets we are working on.

### 📖 Contributing

If you are interested in contributing, you can reach out to us on our [Discord server](https://scuffle.tv/discord) or create a issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/ScuffleTV/scuffle)

We are very friendly and we are more than happy to teach you and help you get started.

### 🦀 Our stack

Our stack is mostly Rust and we use a Svelte for the frontend.

You can find the source-code for all of our services on our [monorepo](https://github.com/ScuffleTV/scuffle).
